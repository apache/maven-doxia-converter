          <h2>Maven Doxia</h2>
          <p>Doxia is a content generation framework which aims to provide its users with powerful
            techniques for generating static and dynamic content: Doxia can be used in web-based
            publishing context to generate static sites, in addition to being incorporated into
            dynamic content generation systems like blogs, wikis and content management systems.</p>
          <p>Doxia supports markup languages with simple syntaxes. Lightweight markup languages are
            used by people who might be expected to read the document source as well as the rendered
            output.</p>
          <p>Doxia is used extensively by Maven and it powers the entire documentation system of
            Maven. It gives Maven the ability to take any document that Doxia supports and output it
            any format.</p>
